             <p>Through clear focused intent, coupled with dedicated action I lure thought forms from the invisible into the material realm. To support the endeavor, I cultivate and maintain connection with powerful allies equipped to navigate spaces I may otherwise be unable to. These allies are essentially energy forms themselves, simulatenously ancient and futuristic. My thought form execution assignments are downloaded from the Source. In taking on this particular task of Web Programming course completion,  my pursuit is to develop a skillset that positions me to expand my net (web) worth and reach.</p>
             <p>What's your superpower?</p>
